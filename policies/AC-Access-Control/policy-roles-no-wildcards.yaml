    policy.open-cluster-management.io/description: Detects and prevents the creation of overly permissive RBAC Role objects that use wildcards (*) for API groups, resources, and verbs. Such configurations violate the principle of least privilege (NIST SP 800-53 AC-6) and can grant excessive or unintended access across the cluster. This policy ensures that Roles are scoped to specific resources and actions to maintain secure access control.
